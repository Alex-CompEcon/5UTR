  doc: >
    Model adapted from Sample et al: Human 5 prime UTR design and variant effect prediction from a massively parallel
    translation assay (https://doi.org/10.1101/310375).
    Several modifications have been added to allow arbitrary length inputs, instead of fixed size (50 nucleotides).
  trained_on: > 
    Data from MPRA experiment using eGFP library on HEK293T cells. Trained on eGFP library (260k
    sequences). 
    20,000 sequences were withheld for testing, and additional validations on endogenous data were performed.
